# Spring Boot Application Multidatasource/Starter-Project

The only thing better than a Maven archetype is a repo you can fork with everything already setup to speed up the creation of new Spring Boot based Web applications, just fork-and-code.

This repository contains a **recipe/scaffolding** for bootstrapping a **Monolithic Web Application** with the features & Technology stack listed below. Delete the sample code (or keep it.) and add your own, you‚Äôre good to go.

Essentially it's a simple on-demand application backend for rapd-prototyping.

Features include but not limited to:

- [Multidatasource]
